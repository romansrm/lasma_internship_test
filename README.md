# lasma_internship_test
Internship test for SIA Lasma

## General info
This project is COMPLETE.

requirement of using PHP with a framework was not met.

All functionality requirements were met. Composer not used as no dependencies were used (And honestly i was a bit confused about composer itself)
No 'dokerizēti' functions, i understand them, i get what and why they are, but this project did not follow OOP approach at all (oops) so there are no functions to be dokerizēti.
Front-end isn't there, and as much as i hate to do it i will not add front-end, as it is stated that it's only an option.

I do not know PSR standards too well, like - autoloading (PSR-4), basic clean code(PSR-12), correct php file usage (PSR-1 2.3 specifically) among many other things. Making
the code objectively bad and i am very well aware of it. Using PHP to this extent (with MySQL primarily) is something i havent done before, so i had to learn most of it in parallel
to writing it.

Due to time contraints of having to get an answer ASAP for another work position, the project was done fast and poorly, it is not what I'm capable of, but rather
what I'm capable of within a single evening with my lack of knowladge of PHP and good code principles. 

Code review:
(Will be posted when the answer is recieved)
